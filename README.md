##ValueNoiseLib
######Created by Joseph Dunbar
------
This is a library of functions that produce value noise in up to 4 dimensions, with their respective gradients (see "C Code/valuenoise.h" for function definitions).

Included in "C Code" is a makefile which will build the project. Using the command "make run" will build and run the project files, which will output a sample image called "valuenoise.pgm".



*Note: the gradient returns should be correct, but they have not been experimentally tested*

**TODO**: 
  *Unity3D Jobs implementation
  *HLSL port
